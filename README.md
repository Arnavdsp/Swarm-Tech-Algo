# Swarm Technology Algorithms


**Swarm Technology** is a cutting-edge field in robotics and artificial intelligence that models the **collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems**. In this project we study swarm logic in multi-agent robotic systems.

The robots interact locally with one another and the environment, exhibiting **emergent intelligence** that mirrors natural swarms. The project merges **distributed algorithms**, **sensor-based navigation**, and **real-time control** to demonstrate how small simple agents can achieve complex group behaviors.


This repository presents three foundational swarm intelligence algorithms, each implemented in Python and designed for clarity, extensibility, and educational value. These algorithms are widely used in optimization, robotics, and artificial intelligence, and serve as a robust starting point for research or practical applications.

## Algorithms Included

- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO):**  
  Simulates the foraging behavior of ants to solve combinatorial optimization problems such as the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).

- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):**  
  Models the social behavior of bird flocks or fish schools to find optimal solutions in continuous search spaces.

- **Artificial Bee Colony (ABC):**  
  Mimics the foraging strategy of honey bees to efficiently explore and exploit complex solution landscapes.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Swarm-Tech-Algo.git
   cd Swarm-Tech-Algo
   ```

2. **Run any algorithm:**
   - Each script is self-contained and can be executed directly.
   - Example:
     ```
     python ant_colony_optimization.py
     python particle_swarm_optimization.py
     python artificial_bee_colony.py
     ```

3. **Modify and Experiment:**
   - Each file contains a demo problem and can be easily adapted for your own use cases.

## Algorithm Highlights

### Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
- Solves the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using artificial pheromone trails and probabilistic path construction.
- Demonstrates how collective behavior can yield near-optimal solutions to complex routing problems.

### Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
- Finds the minimum of a continuous function by simulating a population of particles moving through the search space.
- Each particle adjusts its trajectory based on its own experience and that of the swarm, converging to the best solution.

### Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)
- Optimizes a function by simulating the roles of employed, onlooker, and scout bees.
- Balances exploration and exploitation to efficiently search for global optima.
